# Atlas

This repository contains data about countries, making it easy to whip
up APIs or gain access to relevant data.

## 📗 Documentation

Find the [full documentation](https://markhj.github.io/atlas/) on GitHub pages.

## 🌍 Territories, disputes, etc.

When it comes to disputes and territories, we will do our best to
display the transparency and disagreements as part of the data.

If you believe we have made a mistake, please open an issue.
However, please note that we do not change data based on political
_opinion_. We work from a basis of **broad recognition**.
